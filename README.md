# Friday Night Funkin': John Williams' Funky Adventure (JWFA)

This is a Friday Night Funkin' mod based off of one of my older games John Williams' Adventure.

To summarize it all, you somehow manage to spawn in through John's journey to leave a studio that's infected with a disease that makes people murderous and have a few rap battles along the way, somehow without catching the disease. Oh yeah, there's also some Doom stuff in there, I guess.
